# CODETECH-IT--PUSH-BUTTON-COUNTER-TASK-1

NAME : SRIMATHI

COMPANY : CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

INTERN ID : CT08QQF

DOMAIN : EMBEDDED SYSTEMS

DURATION :  FEBRUARY 5th, 2025 to MARCH 5th, 2025 (4 WEEKS)

MENTOR : NEELA SANTHOSH

### **Objective** – To design a push-button counter using an Arduino microcontroller that increments and displays the count on an I2C LCD and Serial Monitor.

### **Key Components** – The system consists of an Arduino, a push button, a 16x2 I2C LCD.

Debouncing Implementation – A delay is added to prevent false multiple counts due to switch bouncing.

Display Mechanism – The count is shown on both the Serial Monitor and the LCD screen for real-time monitoring.

### **Technology Used** – The system utilizes Arduino programming, I2C communication for LCD, and digital input handling for accurate button press detection.

**SIMULATOR OUTPUT**
